I am SÃ¶ren, a master student at the University of Potsdam in the field of Cognitive Systems. I am fascinated by Machine Learning (still trying to get my head around Deep Learning though), Natural Language Processing and everything that involves data (especially visualising data).

I want to start an experiment: in recent months I have been working on many side projects, but most of them just endedwithout a clear result or any shareable outcome. That is going to change. In this blog I want to share some of the ideas and projects I am working on. I am also planning to use it as a notebook for my progress in writing my master thesis (summarizing papers, sketching ideas or showing first results). Let's see how long I can keep this blog going.

I don't want to spend too many words upfront, let's get started!
